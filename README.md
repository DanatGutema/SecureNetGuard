📌 Project: Detection of Fake URLs and Malware Prevention using Machine Learning (SecureNetGuard)
In an age of increasing cyber threats, phishing attacks remain one of the most common and dangerous risks. This project focuses on building a machine learning–based application to detect phishing URLs and provide real-time protection against malicious links.

🔍 Key Features:
Trained on a Kaggle dataset with 49,000+ labeled URLs (benign and phishing)

Extracted features such as URL length, dot count, digit count, and more

Implemented and compared Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers

Achieved high detection accuracy using Random Forest due to its robustness and feature importance insights

Real-time URL classification logic simulated using browser-integrated logic

Includes system architecture, use case, class, and sequence diagrams

Future enhancements include NLP-based phishing detection, behavioral analytics, and blockchain integration

⚙️ Tools & Technologies:
Python · Pandas · Scikit-learn · Random Forest · Decision Tree · Kaggle Dataset · VS Code
